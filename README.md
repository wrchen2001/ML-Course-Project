# Machine-Learning-Course-Project

## Overview
The topic of this course practice is multivariate time series forecasting based on sequence models. We use three methods to accomplish this task: LSTM, Transformer, and xxxx. The relevant models and code are in the corresponding folders.
## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is from [code](https://github.com/zhouhaoyi/Informer2020). We choose ETTh1.csv as our dataset. The dataset contains 17,420 entries, each of which contains 8-dimensional features, including date, the predicted value "Oil Temperature (OT)", and 6 different types of external load values. Train/Val/Test is splited into 6:2:2, which means that the training set has 10,452 entries, and the validation and test sets have 3484 entries each.
